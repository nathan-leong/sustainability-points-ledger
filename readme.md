This codebase is for the Sustainability Points Ledger application and contains both the frontend application written in React, and the ethereum contract code built and deployed with hardhat.

The application intends to create a platform to record sustainability contributions on the blockchain, and display a consumers individual contribution in comparison to others in their local community and around the world.
Sponsors can then allow consumers to use their points as weighted votes on sustainability community project proposals.
